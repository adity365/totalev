            transfer fee and must be approved by the Company. Sale of a corporation or other legal entity, which owns a

            transferable in accordance with the terms of a Will, or, in the absence of a Will, it passes to heirs pursuant
            to the applicable interstate succession laws. For those Associates whose VACANTTREE.COM Business Nodes is/are
            owned by a corporation (or some other type of legal entity), there would be no change in the ownership of the
            Business Node upon the death of an owner of that corporation, etc. Ownership of the corporation would change by
            passing to the heirs, but the corporation would continue to own the VACANTTREE.COM Business Node.
