        <b>Website's Privacy Commitment - Overview</b>
        <br><br>
        Website is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We
        want to provide a safe, secure user experience. The following statement
        explains Website's commitment to managing your personal information
        and sets out how and when personal information is collected, held, used
        or disclosed.
        <br><br>
        <b>Information About All Website Visitors </b>
        <br><br>We gather information about all of our users collectively, such
        as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users
        access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the
        aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial
        for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall
        experience for you. We may share this information with our partners,
        but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Website
        visitors use our site, and also create a better overall
        experience for you. We do not disclose information about your
        individual visits to Website to any outside parties, except when
        the law requires it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Information About You Specifically</b>
        <br><br>Website is a career site, we retain your personal
        information to assist in your career performance or management
        including finding or retaining work; or to facilitate other services to
        or by us.
        For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest,
        or purchase a product, we collect more specific personal information
        about you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number,
        credit card number, qualifications or career history.
        If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive information about
        you such as information about your membership in a professional or
        trade association or trade union.
        We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your
        interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of
        jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the
        best possible site experience. When you grant us your permission, we
        will communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey
        information on using the Website site to maximise your career
        development. Website also provides you with the opportunity to
        opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive
        these types of communications at the time of registration, but later
        decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your My Website account and edit your account
        profile.
        If you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such
        as that of a Website and partner company-sponsored contest, then
        your information will be collected, used and becomes the property of
        both Website and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that
        instance, Website is not responsible for the information that the
        partner company receives or how it is used.
        If you do not provide us with the information sought in the required
        fields Website may be limited in its ability to provide you with
        services.
        <br><br>
        <b>Use and Disclosure of the Information We Collect Resumes</b>
        <br><br>
        We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this:
        <ol>
            <li>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it
                to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters. Not allowing
                your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a
                job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search
                it through our resume database product.</li>
            <li>You can allow your
                resume to be searchable by employers, recruiters, hiring managers,
                headhunters, and human resource professionals who pay for access to our
                resume database and your resume. When you opt to make your resume
                searchable, you still have the choice to make your personal details
                confidential where all of your contact information and even your
                current place of employment can remain hidden. We use our best efforts
                to restrict access to our database only to those who have paid for
                access; these parties may retain a copy of your resume in their own
                files or databases. We take all reasonable steps to ensure parties
                other than those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain
                access to this database. We endeavour to ensure those who gain access
                to your resume comply with the relevant privacy laws, however Website is not responsible for the
                retention, use, or privacy of
                resumes by any third parties. We may share your information with our
                related companies. You may remove your resume from our searchable
                database at any time.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
